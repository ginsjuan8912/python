# My Python Learning - Book

Hi there, I have create this repo to show my status while learning how to write optimized algorithms in python and some personal mini-projects that I'm challenging myself to learn different python topics.

So far I have been able to:

 1. Create a Paper, Scissor, Rock game with the basics of python.
 2. Create a word-guessing game with Tkniker that read an open book in text format, classifies the words from easy to hard, and I use a UI to let the user guess
    the words in an interval of 20 seconds, the game itself will be providing letter so the user could guys easily, at the end the player could see the score.
 3. Create an application using Flask to shorten an URL or image.
 4. Write some complex algoritms that resolve a particular problem.
